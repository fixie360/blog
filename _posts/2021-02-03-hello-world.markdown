Hello, World!

My name is Trev and this blog is a record of my projects and learning outcomes as I work my way towards becoming a cloud engineer.

I have a background in Systems Administration and have been updating my skills as I seek to become more fluent in full-stack software development in a cloud context.

I was inspired to create this blog after coming across [Forrest Brazeal's Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions/). This challenge is for aspiring cloud engineers to build a resume website using cloud technologies. In doing this challenge, one can demonstrate a real world knowledge of the skills needed to be a cloud engineer.

The last step of the challenge was to write a blog post on what has been learned but I've decided to go one step further and use this blog to not only write about the challenge, but also to write about learning journey as a whole. The challenge is actually already over but I'm still interested to try it and use it as a foundation for ongoing projects.

To date, I already have a couple of personal cloud projects under my belt but apart from some vague notes in readme files, I've not left myself a lot of information on them. Particularly, how they're built, why they're built that way, how to use them and what's left to do. So this blog will be a good place to record that information.

In writing about existing and future projects I hope to add context to some of my decision points and give me the opportunity to reflect on what I've made and learned.

So thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read. I look forward to sharing my journey with you.

Trev
